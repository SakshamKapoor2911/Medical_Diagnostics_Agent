        "Welcome! In this workshop, we'll build a smart AI Agent that can:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Chat with a user** to understand their symptoms.\n",
        "2.  **Decide** when it has gathered enough information to move to research.\n",
        "3.  **Use external tools** (like Perplexity's API) to narrow down medical conditions.\n",
        "4.  **Analyze the findings** and the conversation.\n",
        "5.  **Generate a structured report.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a simplified version of a preliminary medical consultation. But **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** this is for educational purposes ONLY and is NOT a substitute for real medical professionals (yetðŸ˜‰)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this interesting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLMs as Orchestrators:** We'll see how Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini can evolve beyond only generating text and also *control a workflow*, make decisions, and use tools.\n",
        "* **LangChain & LangGraph:** We'll use these powerful libraries designed to make building complex AI applications easier. LangGraph helps create reliable, step-by-step AI processes through state management.\n",
        "* **Real-world Pattern:** Similar patterns to this one (chat -> gather info -> use tools -> synthesize) are common in many professions, and can be leveraged to automate real jobs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:** Gemini and Perplexity API. We'll explain the AI concepts as we go!\n",

Select the secrets option on left-side handle, and add the GEMINI_API_KEY and PERPLEXITY_API_KEY fields, pasting the API keys in the text fields. This saves the API keys to colab and make them accessible to the colab notebook we'll use for our workshop."

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\\n\\nSLE, commonly known as lupus, appears to be the most likely diagnosis based on the symptom pattern. The combination of fatigue, joint pain, facial rash (particularly on the cheeks), and sensitivity to sunlight strongly aligns with classic lupus symptoms[1][3][5].\\n\\n**Key matching symptoms:**\\n- Extreme fatigue that doesn't improve with rest\\n- Joint pain in hands and knees\\n- Red patches on cheeks that worsen with sun exposure\\n- Low-grade fevers\\n- Shortness of breath with exertion\\n\\n**Causes and risk factors:**\\nLupus is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. The exact cause remains unknown, but several factors may contribute:\\n- Genetic predisposition\\n- Environmental triggers (sunlight, infections)\\n- Hormonal factors (more common in women of childbearing age)\\n\\nThe symptoms described show a pattern of flare-ups and remissions typical of lupus, where symptoms worsen for periods and then improve[5].\\n\\n### 2. Raynaud's Phenomenon\\n\\nThe symptom of fingers turning pale and numb when exposed to cold is characteristic of Raynaud's phenomenon[5]. While this can occur as a standalone condition, it's also frequently associated with lupus and other autoimmune disorders.\\n\\n**Key matching symptoms:**\\n- Fingers turning pale and numb when cold\\n\\n**Causes and risk factors:**\\n- Can be primary (occurring alone) or secondary (associated with another condition like lupus)\\n- Triggered by cold temperatures or stress\\n- More common in women\\n\\n### 3. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease\\n\\nThis condition combines features of lupus, scleroderma, and polymyositis, and often presents with Raynaud's phenomenon as an early symptom.\\n\\n**Key matching symptoms:**\\n- Fatigue\\n- Joint pain\\n- Raynaud's phenomenon\\n- Shortness of breath\\n- Low-grade fevers\\n\\n## Diagnostic Steps\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive blood tests:**\\n   - Complete blood count (CBC)\\n   - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test (positive in most lupus patients)\\n   - Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody test\\n   - Anti-Smith antibody test\\n   - Complement levels (often low in active lupus)\\n   - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation\\n\\n2. **Specialized testing:**\\n   - Chest X-ray or pulmonary function tests to evaluate shortness of breath\\n   - Urinalysis to check for kidney involvement (common in lupus)\\n\\n3. **Clinical evaluation:**\\n   - Detailed physical examination focusing on skin, joints, and cardiovascular system\\n   - Assessment of the malar (butterfly) rash on cheeks\\n   - Joint examination for swelling, tenderness, and range of motion\\n\\n4. **Rheumatology consultation:**\\n   - Referral to a rheumatologist who specializes in autoimmune conditions is essential for proper diagnosis and management\\n\\nThe symptom pattern strongly suggests lupus as the primary consideration. The combination of fatigue, joint pain, facial rash exacerbated by sun exposure, and Raynaud's phenomenon creates a clinical picture highly consistent with SLE[1][3][5]. The intermittent nature of symptoms with periods of flare-ups is also characteristic of lupus[5].\\n\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment are important for managing lupus effectively and preventing potential complications. If these symptoms are present, medical evaluation should be sought promptly.\"}, 'delta': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''}}]}\n",

        "\n",
        "* **LLMs can orchestrate:** They don't just generate text; they can follow steps, use tools, and make autonomous decisions within a defined structure.\n",
        "* **LangGraph provides structure:** It allows us to build complex, stateful AI workflows reliably by defining nodes (steps) and edges (transitions).\n",
        "* **State is crucial:** Managing the conversation history, intermediate results, and current stage is essential for multi-turn interactions for complex tasks.\n",
        "* **Tools enhance LLMs:** Giving LLMs access to external APIs or functions dramatically increases their capabilities, making them experts at tasks.\n",
        "* **Prompting is key:** Carefully crafted prompts (System prompts, prompts for nodes. tools) guide the AI's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Further Exploration:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Add more tools (e.g., a calculator, a database lookup).\n",
        "* Experiment with different LLMs or prompt strategies on new use cases.\n",
        "* Explore LangSmith for debugging and tracing your graph runs."
